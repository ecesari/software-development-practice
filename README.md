# What is Git?
Git is a version control system that is widely used by developers and also teams. 

# Why do we need a version control system?
Without a version control the programs that we write would become unmanageable. Version control systems make it easier to follow who changed what part of a software and when. It keeps track of the code that is being written over time. Personally, I have used version control systems since I was a junior developer and I even use them for my personal projects as well. Git helps keep all of my code in the same place and also helps me track the cahnges I have made to them.
